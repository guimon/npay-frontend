By creating a Npay account, you consent to Npay to share your information with merchants you use the Npay Services with, for those merchants to market to you. We do this to help merchants personalize services and offers, so you can have a better experience. You’re able to revoke your consent at any time by following the steps below. If you choose to do so, we will stop sharing your information with merchants from that point onward, except as necessary to complete transactions you initiate.

Alternatively, you may be able to indicate your preference by logging into your account and adjusting your preferences or by following the directions provided with the communication. Npay reserves the right to close or limit access to your account should you opt out of the crucial notices that are required to perform the Npay Service. You are still responsible for any amounts due to Npay even if we close or limit access to your account.


#### 6.2. SMS Messaging.

You can opt out of receiving SMS messages by emailing help@npay.care.

If you close your Npay account, we will mark your account in our database as “Closed,” but will keep your account information in our database to comply with our legal obligations. This is necessary in order to deter fraud, by ensuring that persons who try to commit fraud will not be able to avoid detection simply by closing their account and opening a new account. If you close your account, your personally identifiable information will not be used by us for any further purposes, nor sold or shared with third parties, except as necessary to prevent fraud and assist law enforcement, as required by law or in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
