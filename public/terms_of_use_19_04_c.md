#### 1.1. The Parties to this Agreement.

These Terms of Service describe a contractual relationship ("Agreement") between you ("you" or "your") and Npay, Corp. (including its subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, and assigns) ("Npay," "we," "us," "our"), formerly known as Expedite, Inc. or Expedite Software, regarding your use of this website ("Website") or the Npay mobile application (the “App”), your use of the "Pay with Npay" service as described below in Section 2.1, your use of “Additional Tools” as described below in Section 2.2, your use of any other service(s) offered through the Website or App, and your access to your Npay account information and service through the Website or App (collectively, the "Npay Service(s)" or "Service(s)").


#### 1.2. Changes to this Agreement.

Npay may unilaterally decide to change this Agreement from time to time, provided, however, that such changes will not impose additional obligations on you with respect to actions you took before the change became effective unless you specifically agree to such changes (for example, by confirming a Installment Credit). Additionally, YOU AGREE TO ACCEPT ANY CHANGES TO THIS AGREEMENT BY USING THE Npay SERVICES AFTER CHANGES HAVE BEEN POSTED. If Npay makes any changes to this Agreement that it deems to be material, Npay will make a reasonable effort to inform you of such changes, but it is your responsibility to review the Agreement posted to our website from time to time to see if it has been changed.


#### 1.3. Your Eligibility.

To be eligible to use the Services, you must be at least 18 years old (19 years old in Alabama or if you're a ward of the state in Nebraska) and a resident of the United States or its territories. Residents of Iowa and West Virginia are not eligible for the "Pay with Npay" service. You represent and warrant that you are eligible to use the Services.


## 2. How Npay will serve you.


#### 2.1. The "Pay with Npay" Service.

2.1.1. Description: "Pay with Npay" is a closed-end Installment Credit product with standard terms of 3, 6, or 12 months (other terms may be available at select Providers) through Npay's technology platform. Installment Credit term options may vary based on purchase price and Provider. "Pay with Npay" allows you to buy goods or services offered by Providers ("Providers") for personal use. If you agree to use "Pay with Npay," Npay will pay the Provider on your behalf in exchange for your promise to repay the same amount plus a finance charge as determined by your creditworthiness.

2.1.2. Your Promise to Pay: Before completing any transaction on your behalf through any Npay Services, Npay will secure your promise to pay by disclosing the terms and conditions applicable to that transaction and securing your Npayative consent to those terms for that transaction, including your promise to pay the Total Payments by asking you to click the button to confirm your Installment Credit.

2.1.3. Interest Rates: "Pay with Npay" rates range from 10% to 30% fixed Annual Percentage Rate ("APR"), depending on your creditworthiness (0% APR is offered at select Providers). "Pay with Npay" Installment Credits are simple interest Installment Credits, which means that interest accrues daily on the unpaid principal balance, up to the amount of the finance charge, until you pay the Installment Credit in full. If, however, you pay your Installment Credit off early, the Prepayment Refund terms below may apply.

2.1.4. Finance Charge: The "Pay with Npay" service is subject to a finance charge based on the applicable interest rate determined by your creditworthiness. Npay will always disclose the specific finance charge before you agree to any Installment Credit.

2.1.5. First Payment: Your first payment will be due no sooner than 15 days after Npay pays a Provider on your behalf pursuant to the "Pay with Npay" service.

2.1.6. Late Payment Fee: You will never be charged any late fees for using "Pay with Npay."

2.1.7. Payment Allocation: Payments that you make will be applied first to accrued unpaid interest then to the unpaid principal balance. For Installment Credits that are delinquent, your payment will be applied first to past due amounts, then to your current monthly payment. For Installment Credits that are charged off, your payment will be applied first to the unpaid principal balance, then to accrued unpaid interest.

2.1.8. Partial Prepayments: Payments in excess of your currently scheduled payment will be applied to your unpaid principal balance and will not be used toward your next scheduled payment. Thus, your monthly scheduled payment amounts will remain the same except for your final payment.

2.1.9. No Prepayment Penalty: You may prepay your Installment Credit in full at any time without penalty.

2.1.10. Prepayment Refund: You are entitled to a refund of any amounts you pay in excess of the remaining principal balance and accrued interest as of the date of prepayment. We, however, may set off any amounts you are entitled to against any amounts you owe on any other "Pay with Npay" Installment Credit or owe us otherwise. In lieu of a prepayment refund, you may satisfy your repayment obligation under the "Pay with Npay" service on any date prior to the date of the final payment by paying Npay an amount equal to the unpaid balance, less the required rebate as of the date of such a payment.

2.1.11. Delays in Processing: In some cases when you attempt to use "Pay with Npay" to pay for medical or veterinary services, the transaction may be held as pending or be otherwise delayed for processing and confirmation by either Npay or the Provider and can be cancelled at any time until it is confirmed by Npay.


#### 2.2 Additional Tools.

2.2.1. Tools We May Offer: We may from time to time offer you the ability to access certain financial management tools. Examples of such tools include financial calculators, customized financial analysis, bill payment reminders, dashboards with information about your debts (including debts you may owe others) and/or assets, and other similar services. Unless we indicate otherwise, these tools will be provided free of charge and are provided exclusively for personal use.

2.2.2. Limitations on Tools: You agree that we may modify the tools or cease making them available to you at any time without notice. We have no obligation to continue to make any particular tool available to you or to do so without charge. If we modify a tool or cease to make a tool available to you, you understand that you may lose access to any information that you may have supplied in connection with your use of the tool and have no rights to obtain such information from us. To the extent that the tools present information regarding financial accounts you may have with other lenders or financial institutions, you understand that the information may not be up to date. Before acting on any such information, you should confirm its accuracy with the lender or financial institution holding the account. There may be times when a tool we offer is unavailable or not properly functioning, and you agree that we have no liability to you if this occurs or in connection with the tools generally. You may need certain hardware or software to utilize the tools, and you understand that your failure to have such hardware or software will result in your not being able to use the tools or some tool functionality. You understand that some tools or some tool functionality may only be available to consumers who have relationships with certain lenders, service providers or financial institutions or who have certain financial products. If you do not have such relationships or products, you understand that you may not be eligible to use a tool or all of its functionality. You agree that we may use the information we gather through the tools to market other products and/or services to you, including those of third parties.

2.2.3. Third Party Providers: We may rely on third party providers to assist us in making a tool or other Npay Service available to you. By linking your bank account to a tool or Service, you authorize us and our third party providers to access your financial accounts on your behalf, and to gather information about you. You give us and our third party providers a limited power of attorney, and appoint us and our third party providers as your true and lawful attorney-in-fact and agent to act on your behalf and access, transmit, and use your information as necessary to provide the tools and other Services. You agree to the transfer, storage, and processing of your information by these third party providers in accordance with their respective privacy policies, including [Plaid's privacy policy](https://plaid.com/legal/). We have no liability to you for any damages you may suffer as a result of any such third party's actions or inactions or from inaccurate account information.

2.2.4. Tools are Provided for Informational Purposes Only: Financial information provided through the tools is provided for informational purposes only and not a substitute for individualized professional advice. We are not a credit repair or credit services organization as defined under federal or state law, including any credit repair or credit services organization acts. We do not provide “credit services” or “credit repair” services. We do not advise or assist you with “rebuilding” or “improving” your credit. We make no representation that we will improve or attempt to improve your credit record, history or rating. The tools are not intended to provide financial, legal or tax advice, and we are not a financial planner, broker or tax advisor. The tools are intended only to provide general assistance in organizing your finances. Before making any financial decisions or implementing any strategy, you should consider obtaining additional information and advice from your accountant or other financial advisers who are fully aware of your individual circumstances.

2.2.5. Accuracy, Reliability and Timeliness of Information: YOUR USE OF THE TOOLS IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. INFORMATION PROVIDED THROUGH THE TOOLS IS ON AN “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” BASIS FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY. WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE TOOLS WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS OR EXPECTATIONS, OR BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE, ACCURATE OR RELIABLE.


#### 2.3. Cancelling Transactions.

Npay may choose not to provide service to you or to specific Provider at any time for any reason, including but not limited to, your creditworthiness, your history of transactions on our site, the Provider's account history or any other reason. Npay may cancel transactions at any time before a Provider delivers any goods or services if you violate any term of this Agreement.


#### 2.4. Collecting Information About You.

By using the Npay Services, you authorize Npay, directly or through third parties, to make any inquiries we consider necessary to validate your identity and to collect information about you in accordance with the Customer Identification Program (CIP) rules implementing Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and our Privacy Policy. This may include asking you for further information that will allow us to reasonably identify you, requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address or financial instruments, or verifying your information against third party databases or through other sources. We may also ask you for identifying documents to help us validate your identity. Npay reserves the right to close, suspend, or limit access to your account and/or the Services in the event we are unable to obtain or verify this information.


#### 2.5. Credit Report Authorization and Reporting.

You expressly authorize Npay, Corp. to obtain consumer reports from consumer reporting agencies about you (1) when you apply for an Installment Credit, (2) periodically throughout the term of your Installment Credit (including in the month following the month when you pay off or otherwise satisfy the Installment Credit) and (3) periodically in connection with any other services you may obtain from us (including services involving financial management or credit profile tools we may offer). You expressly authorize us to use the information that we obtain from such reports to, among other things, market refinancings and Npay's current and future products and services to you (both during and after the term of your Installment Credit and the term of any other services you may obtain from us), provide you with other services (including financial management tools and credit profile tools) you may request, make decisions related to the servicing and collection of your account, measure how the Installment Credit you obtained from us impacts your credit, perform other statistical analysis, and share information with you about your credit profile.

You understand that Npay may report information about your Installment Credit (such as on-time, late, and missed payments; any defaults; and the fact you paid off your Installment Credit) to credit reporting agencies.


#### 2.6. Collection.

You agree to allow Npay to send you payment reminders from time-to-time. Notwithstanding whether you have consented or withdrawn your consent to the Npay E-Sign Consent, you agree that payment reminders may take the form of any available communication. You also agree that if you fail to pay an amount owed to Npay pursuant to this Agreement, Npay may engage in collection efforts to recover such amounts from you. These collection efforts may involve contacting you directly, submitting your information to a collection agency, or taking legal action. FAILURE TO PAY MAY AFFECT YOUR CREDIT SCORE.


#### 2.7. Communication & Notification.

You agree that Npay may provide you communications about your account and the Npay Service electronically or through phone calls or in writing. Standard mobile, message, or data rates may apply and you are responsible for any such fees. Npay reserves the right to close or limit access to your account and immediately collect all due amounts if you withdraw your consent to receive electronic or other communications or if you revoke access to any third party site on which the Npay Service relies (e.g., Plaid, etc.) or if any such service should revoke or cancel your account on that site. Any electronic communications will be considered to be received by you within 24 hours of the time we email it to you or otherwise send it to your attention (such as via sms or other online or mobile notification). We may assume you have received any communications sent to you by postal mail 3 business days after we send it.

You also acknowledge that granting permission to a third party to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this Agreement.

## 5. How Npay will resolve disputes.


#### 5.1. Disputes with Npay.

If a dispute arises between you and Npay, our goal is to provide you with a neutral and cost-effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. In the event of a dispute we encourage you first to contact Npay at help@npay.care to try resolving your problem directly with us.


#### 5.2. Mandatory Arbitration.

THIS SECTION AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS, PLEASE READ CAREFULLY BEFORE AGREEING TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE BY USING THE Npay SERVICE OR THE WEBSITE. Except as explicitly provided in this Agreement, any dispute or claim relating in any way to your visit to the Website, your use of the Npay Services, a product offered or provided by or through the Website or Service, or otherwise arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Services that cannot be resolved directly between you and Npay shall be resolved by non-appearance based binding arbitration, rather than in court. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, this includes any claims based in contract, statute, tort, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory. The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement. There is no judge or jury in arbitration and court review of an arbitration award is limited, but an arbitrator can award an individual the same damages and relief as a court and must apply and follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ABSENT THIS PROVISION, YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.

Either you or we can initiate arbitration through the alternative dispute resolution provider the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") pursuant to the then-current Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (the "Consumer Rules"), both of which are available at the AAA website [www.adr.org](http://www.adr.org/). Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, Npay will pay all arbitration fees and expenses.

The arbitration shall be conducted by telephone or electronic means and/or shall be solely based on written submissions, the specific manner of which shall be chosen by the party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless the arbitrator determines that an in-person hearing is necessary based on the request of one of the parties and any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. You and Npay each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, we each waive any right to a jury trial and agree to proceed only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action. The parties hereby appoint the arbitrator the exclusive power to rule on any challenges to the requirement for the use of alternative dispute resolution process in these terms.

We also both agree that you or we may bring suit in court to obtain interim or preliminary injunctive relief necessary to protect the rights or property of you or Npay and all of its partners, affiliates, shareholders, employees, and agents of any kind (together, our "Affiliates").

Except as explicitly provided elsewhere in this Agreement, all claims you bring against Npay must be resolved in accordance with this Section. Any claim filed or brought contrary to this Section shall be considered improperly filed. Should you file a claim contrary to this Section, Npay may recover from you attorneys' fees and costs up to $1,500 per claim, provided that Npay first has notified you in writing of the improperly filed claim and you have failed to promptly withdraw the claim.


#### 5.3. Restrictions.

You and Npay agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the dispute between Npay and you individually. To the fullest extent permitted by law, (1) no arbitration shall be joined with any other; (2) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and (3) there is no right or authority for any dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.


#### 5.4. Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration.

You and Npay agree that the following disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and binding arbitration: (1) any disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of, any of your or Npay's intellectual property rights; and (2) any claim for injunctive relief.

Upon Npay's request, you will furnish Npay any documentation, substantiation or releases necessary to verify your compliance with these Terms of Service.

The failure of Npay to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service does not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. These Terms of Service constitutes the entire agreement between you and Npay with regard to your use of the Npay Services and any previous Terms of Service that may exist between you and Npay is hereby superseded. These Terms of Service cannot be changed or modified by you except as posted on the Services by Npay. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, the unenforceable term or provision shall be replaced by an enforceable term or provision that comes closest to the intention underlying the unenforceable term or provision and the remaining provisions shall be enforced. To the extent that anything in or associated with the Services is in conflict or inconsistent with this Agreement, this Agreement shall take precedence. The laws of the State of Delaware govern your access to, and use of, the Services and the terms of this Agreement.

The copying, redistribution, use or publication by you of any part of the Services, unless expressly permitted in this Agreement, is strictly prohibited. Use of the Services does not give you ownership of any intellectual property rights in any of the content, documents or other materials you access. The posting of information or materials on the Services does not constitute a waiver of any right in such information and materials.
